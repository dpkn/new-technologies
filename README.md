# webVR Note sequencer
**Documentation related to the HKU course New Technologies can be found [here](https://github.com/dpkn/webvr-music/tree/master/documentation).**

A simple note sequencer to create an audio loop in WebVR.

Only tested on the Oculus Quest using the Firefox Reality browser. For reason unbeknown to me audio doesn't work in the Oculus Browser.

To test, use a local server like [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) and navigate to the URL on your headset using Firefox Reality.
